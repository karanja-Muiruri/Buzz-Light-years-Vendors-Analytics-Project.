 ### Exploratory Data Analysis 
 EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key tasks, such as;
  - Analyzing the locations of the vendors for all customers that have yet to complete the repair on their Buzz Light years.
  - Removing any customers that don't have a home address.
  - Building a dashboard highlighting the concentrations for guidance on where to send repair trucks first.
  - Isolating customers living in the most densely populated area in the state of Victoria (Australia).
  - Showing the models originally purchased by these customers.
